# Learn more about me...

My name is Bartol Deak. I'm 16 years old High School student currently living in [Zadar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zadar/),
[Croatia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Croatia/). I started learning full stack web development last year and so far I'm enjoying it a
lot.

<br />

Right now I'm focused on learning front and back end technologies to build awesome websites.
I value accessibility because making the web accessible for everyone is as valuable
as making it fast and beautiful.
